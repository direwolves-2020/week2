### Lesson


#### Part 1 - Big O Notation

* Big O Notation is a way to check/describe how efficient an algorithm is. That is how long it takes to run

* Not enough to know how long an algorithm takes to run — You need to know how the running time increases as the list size increases. Thats where Big O comes in
* Big O tells you how fast the algorithm grows, and lets you compare the number of operations that different algorithms will run. It tells you the number of operations an algorithm will execute (eg. O(n)), and how they will increase as the size of your input increases (proportional)
* Big O establishes a worst case run time: O(n) will never be slower than O(n) time based on number of inputs
* Examples include linear and binary search, or creating a grid by either drawing squares on paper one after the other, or folding the piece of paper 4 times to make 16 squares

* Looping through a list of items in a linear fashion will be a `O(n)`
* Having a loop nested inside of another loop will be an `O(n^2)`
* Using the Binary Search would be a `O(logn)`

##### Sample Big O run times

* O(logn) -- log time. Example: Binary search.
* O(n) -- linear time. Example: Simple search.
* O(n * log n). Example: Quicksort.
* O(n^2). Slow. Example: Selection sort.
* O(n!). Slooooooooww.



***Five Min Exercise***

* What would be the Big O of the following three functions?

```
def the_names():
	for name in people:
		print name
	
	

def your_func():
	for num in numbers:
		print num
	
	for char in characters:
		print char
		
		
		
def my_func():
	for x in xyz:
		for a in abc:
			print x
			
	for i in j:
		print i

```
* We only use the most significant terms
	* If we had a function with two for loops(not nested) it would be `O(2n)`. However, we would drop the 2 from that equation because as n gets exponemtially larger the two doesn't matter. 
	* If we had a function with three loops, loop A was a stand alone, and loop C was nested in loop B it would be `O(n + n^2)`. We would drop the smaller n in this equation for the same reason as the previous example


#### Part 2 - Linked List

* The concept of Linked List is to have a list of values to search through. 
* This sounds similar to an array but it is very different, with it's own advantages and disadvantages
* A `Linked List` stores data in `nodes`
* Each node will contain two things. A `value` that node is storing, and a `pointer` that will point to the next node in the list
* The first node in a linked list is known as the `head`

***So how is this different from python list, or arrays in other languages?***

* With linked list we are not storing/declaring our data set initially. Instead we are only looking at one node at a time. This will save us memory. 
* The advantage to this versus an array/list is we will not use as much memory to navigate through a list of values. 
* Imagine if we had an extremely large data set. We wouldn't want to store it in memory just to loop through it. 
* The disadvantage to this is since we are not declaring all the values up front we do not have the ability to start a search at a specific point in time. We have to loop through every node until we find what we want. 
* We don't have to declare how big the linked list will be, unlike looping through an array

***Five Min Exercise***

* How do we add a new node in a linked list? 
* Draw a diagram with three nodes: A --> B --> C
* How would you enter a node called "X" in between A and B?

***Answer***

* Placing a node X between two nodes B and C
* Make the pointer on the X node point to the value in the C node 
* Make the B next pointer point to the X node

```
* temp  = A.next
* A.next = X
* X.next = temp

OR more simply

* X.next = B
* A.next = X
```
* The top way with `temp` takes into account how we have to loop through a linked list. The second set in the box is just for demonstration
* Remember that the only sense of direction we get in a linked list is through their `next` pointer. 
* Traveling through an entire linked list one by one is `Big O of n` or "O(n)"
* If a nodes next pointer is `null` we know we are at the end of the list

#### Part 3 - Stacks

* Stacks are abstract data types. Like Linked List this is a concept that is programmable in multiple languages
* This follows the LIFO process. (Last In First Out)
* Every `node` holds a `value` and a `pointer` to the next node
* Imagine a list/array turned 90 degrees to be vertical, where the first element is on the bottom and the last element is on the top
* The main methods to quickly display stacks are `pop` and `append` (push in other lanuages)
* `pop` will remove the top node on the stack and return it to you
* `append` will add a node to the top of the stack

***Five Min Exercise***

* Without using the `reverse` method reverse the string "Hello World"


#### Part 4 - Queues

* Queues are also abstract data types, but they work in the opposite way of stacks. That is they follow the FIFO process (First In, First Out)
* Imagine an array/list normally (not turned 90 degrees like the stack diagram)
* `Enqueue` - add a node to the end of the queue
* `Dequeue` - to remove a node from the front of the queue
