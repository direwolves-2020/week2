Wikipedia on [stacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)).  

Similarly, the Linked List, a stack is an abstract data type. It is LIFO, or Last In First Out. Each node holds data and a pointer to the next node.

The main operations available to the Stack are push and pop. 
- Pop should remove the top node and return it. 
- Push should add to the top of the stack.

#### Objectives

	* Pop - removes from the top of the stack
	* Peek - Find the item at the top of the stack
	* Empty - Checks if the stack is empty
