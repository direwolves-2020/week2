# Bubble Sort

#### Algorithm

A bubble sort is a sorting algorithm with a Big O complexity of O(n**2). It is called bubble sort, because the small numbers "bubble" to the top of the list.

The general flow is to step through the list, continually comparing pairs of numbers. If the number on the left is larger than the number on the right, swap them and continue.

#### Implementation

* Write a function called `bubble_sort()`
* This function will take in a `list` as an `argument`
* This function will return a sorted `list` using the bubble sort algorithm
* Make sure when you test this you are not using an obscenely large data set
